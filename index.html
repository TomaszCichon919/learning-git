    <h2>by Linkin Park</h2>
    <p>I'm tired of being what you want me to be
        Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
        Don't know what you're expecting of me<br>
        Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
    </p>
    <p>
        Every step that I take is another mistake to you
        Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
    </p>
    <p>
        I've become so numb
        I can't feel you there
        Become so tired
        So much more aware
        I'm becoming this
        All I want to do
        Is be more like me
        And be less like you
    </p>
    <p>
        Can't you see that you're smothering me
        Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
        Cause everything that you thought I would be
        Has fallen apart right in front of you
    </p>
    <p>
        Every step that I take is another mistake to you
        (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
        And every second I waste is more than I can take
    </p>
    <p>
        I've become so numb
        I can't feel you there
        Become so tired
        So much more aware
        I'm becoming this
        All I want to do
        Is be more like me
        And be less like you
    </p>
    <p>
        And I know
        I may end up failing too
        But I know
        You were just like me with someone disappointed in you
    </p>
    <p>
        I've become so numb
        I can't feel you there
        Become so tired
        So much more aware
        I'm becoming this
        All I want to do
        Is be more like me
        And be less like you
    </p>
    <p>
        I've become so numb
        I can't feel you there
        (I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
        I've become so numb
        I can't feel you there
        (I'm tired of being what you want me to be)
    </p>
